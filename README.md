# Valuable-Customer-Prediction

This project was to analyze the sales records of a wholesaling company and allocate their investment budget. There were about 600,000 sales records. The sales data contained columns such as invoice #, invoice date, customer ID, order quantity, unit price & cost, product name.

There were 4 phaces in this project. The 1st was data exploration and segmentation which gave a general picture of client and product structure. The 2nd was extracting KPIs from raw data and building a scoring system to evaluate each customer’s performance according the KPIs. The 3rd was training and evaluating models and making predictions on customers’ future performance. The 4th was making recommendations according the prediction.

The 3 folders contain workbooks and slides of the first 3 phaces.
